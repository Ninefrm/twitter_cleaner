# twitter_cleaner
"Manual" automation twitter cleaner, open console, and run the commands;  
I know it can be more automatic, add delays, scrolls, etc, but it was a my fastest.
As well, you have to change the value for your current language on line 28, Delete/Eliminar/etc.
Try to only run it 3 times in a row, give yourself a minute of rest, and keep going, to avoid temporary blocks of api use.
